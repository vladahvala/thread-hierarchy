# Thread-Hierarchy 

A mini-project that demonstrates **the work of threads and thread groups** in Java in real-time.  

## Overview

 **This project shows how to:**

- Create and run multiple threads in Java.

- Organize threads into ThreadGroups and subgroups.

- Monitor active threads using a monitor thread.

- Recursively traverse and print a thread hierarchy.

The project contains:

- `monitorThreadGroup` â€“ a class that contains all the logic (creating threads and their groups, starting them and monitoring their hierarchy).

## Features

- Thread Groups: Organize threads into parent and child groups.

- Monitor Thread: Continuously prints the status of threads in a group until they finish.

- Recursive Hierarchy Printing: Recursively prints all threads and subgroups.

- Simple Task Execution: Threads simulate work by sleeping for a few seconds.
